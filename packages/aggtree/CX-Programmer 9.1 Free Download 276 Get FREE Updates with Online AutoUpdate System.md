Some features of CX-Programmer 9.1 that you can enjoy are:

- Structures and Arrays: You can create advanced programs using data blocks of identical data types (Arrays) or different data types (Structures). You can access the member symbols of the new User Defined Type by using their name. You can also use Structures and Arrays as In/Out variables for a Function Block, which provides a simple way of passing many parameters in a uniform layout .
- Timers and Counters: You can use special data types for TIMER (count-down) and COUNTER (count-up) symbols that simplify the use of timers/counters in ladder programs. You can reset and check them by using their name. You can also define a symbol of type TIMER or COUNTER and let the software handle the memory allocation and management automatically .
- Smart Input: You can input programs with less key presses, resulting in quicker programming. The software provides a predictive-text style browser that shows you possible matches when you type instructions or symbol names. The symbol addresses for the next Input and Output are auto incremented to speed up new program creation. The software also fills in the rung connections automatically, even for more complex operations like parallel contacts (OR) or Function Block invocations .
- Position Control Verification: You can verify the Position Control function by displaying graphs of positions or speeds against time, before transferring the program to the PLC. This helps you to check the accuracy and performance of your program without using any hardware .

With CX-Programmer 9.1, you can create high-quality PLC programs with less effort and time. However, please note that this is a trial version that will expire after a certain period. If you want to use CX-Programmer 9.1 permanently, you will need to purchase a license from Omron or an authorized distributor.
